Developed and deployed this solution from scratch as part of the OneCognizant platform. The project focused on building an Activity Center module using ASP.NET Core Razor Pages and .NET 8. In addition to Teams integration, I was responsible for implementing key backend features such as task management, user activity tracking, and database logging. I designed and consumed secure RESTful APIs using Azure Identity for authentication. On the frontend, I built reusable UI components with Razor partial views and Knockout.js to enable dynamic user interactions. The solution adhered to clean coding practices including layered architecture, centralized exception handling, and dependency injection to ensure scalability and maintainability.",
